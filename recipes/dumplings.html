    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>To make the dipping sauce, heat the olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Stir in 1 clove of garlic and the chopped onion; cook and stir until the onion has softened and turned translucent, about 5 minutes. Stir in the tomato, salt, pepper, and cayenne pepper. Cover and reduce heat to low and continue cooking for 15 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in 1 tablespoon cilantro. Pour sauce into a blender and carefully blend until smooth. Cover and refrigerate until ready to use. </li>
        <li>Combine the ground pork, 1 bunch of cilantro, chopped onion, green onions, garam masala, curry powder, 2 cloves of garlic, ginger paste, salt, and pepper in a large bowl. Place a heaping teaspoon of the pork mixture in the center of a dumpling wrapper. Moisten the edge of the wrapper with a few drops of water. Fold the dumpling in half into a half moon shape. Repeat with the remaining dumplings. </li>
        <li> Place a steamer insert into a saucepan, and fill with water to just below the bottom of the steamer. Cover, and bring the water to a boil over high heat. Add the dumplings, recover, and steam until cooked through, about 15 minutes. Serve with the dipping sauce. </li>
